# esp32_Captdns
A small example how to setup a WEB-Server with Captdns capability.

I setup this code by using existing code and modify it, so it can be easily copied
into the official Toolchain of Esperrif in the Version esp-idf-v2.0-rc1.

I started this project with a post in esp32.com 

ESP32 as stanalone Webserver

Where stanalone a writing error is it should be Standalone ;)

I want to thank the guys who gave me some hints to move on as quick as possible.

Kolban, WiFive and andrew_p

Some of the the posts asked for a Github repository , well I never did that and this is good
opportunity to start doing it.

I hope someone likes it and can use it for educational purpose.
